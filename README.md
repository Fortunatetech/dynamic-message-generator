This project focus on building a Generative AI-based application using a large language model (LLM) that takes user input for placeholders like Patient name, Booked Provider, Alternative Provider, and Time and Date. Based on this input, the system will generate multiple variations of a predefined message. The aim is to generate up to 1000 variations each time, ensuring the generated messages are unique and not repetitive. The system will have a Streamlit-based user interface with input fields for these placeholders and a button to trigger the generation of the messages. The design will use Streamlit's cols function to lay out the UI components.
